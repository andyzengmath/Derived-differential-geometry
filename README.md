# Higher differential geometry seminar (Summer 2019)

Together with Darrick, I am running the **Homotopy theory seminar** continuing in summer 2019 (mainly in June). We are mainly focusing on *higher structure in differential geometry and topology*. Topics includes: *higher holonomy/parallel transport, superconnections/representations up to homotopy, dg manifolds/$L_\infty$ algebroids, simplicial (pre)sheaves, $(\infty,1)$-sheaves/$\infty$-stacks, and string topology*.

**Meeting time:** Each *Tuesday* and *Friday* 1:30pm at **4N30**.
